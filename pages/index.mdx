# Marlow Haspert

I'm Marlow Haspert, a non-binary game developer from Bah√≠a Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina. My pronouns are she/they/he. I am a game developer with five years of background in .NET development. I am a fast learner that likes neat code. Likewise, I enjoy working together with artists, game designers, and diverse profiles to bring new experiences to life. I firmly believe that bridging the gender and diversity gaps in technology areas is our priority.
