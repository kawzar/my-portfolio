# Marlow Haspert

My name is Marlow Haspert and I'm a non-binary game developer from Bah√≠a Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina. My pronouns are she/they/he. I've been working as a .NET developer for five years and now I'm focusing on making video games. I'm a fast learner that likes neat code. I enjoy working together with artists, game designers and diverse profiles to bring new experiences to life. I believe that shrinking the gender and diversity gaps in technology areas is our priority.
